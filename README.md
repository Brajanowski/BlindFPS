# BlindFPS

Prototype of a game where you are blind and you have to escape facility as fast as you can.

This is more experemintal project than the actual game. I have written custom SRP just to get more familiar with api.

How this projects looks as today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEm2jJsV-0w

## TODO
- Enemy with basic AI using BehaviourTree
- Design one or two levels
- Some work with graphics might be done
- Get rid of World Position buffer and decode position from depth buffer instead
